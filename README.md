# Happy Thoughts

A React app where users can share positive thoughts and like others' posts.

## Features

- Post happy thoughts (5-140 characters)
- Like thoughts with a heart button
- Real-time data with Supabase
- Character counter with validation

## Tech

- React + Vite
- Styled Components
- Supabase (Database + API)

## The Problem

The original Technigo API was down (503 Service Unavailable), so I built my own backend using Supabase. This was a good learning experience - I learned how to set up a database, configure API keys, and handle Row Level Security policies.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
